    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>
        I have hands-on experience in software development, encompassing the full software development lifecycleâ€”from requirements gathering and system design to implementation, testing, and deployment. My work has involved developing scalable, maintainable applications using languages like Java, Python, and JavaScript, with a strong focus on clean code practices and version control using Git. I've collaborated in agile teams, participated in daily stand-ups and code reviews, and used tools like Jira and GitHub to manage tasks and track progress. My experience also includes debugging complex issues, optimizing code for performance, and integrating third-party APIs, all while adhering to best practices for security and user experience.
